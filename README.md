# azure-apim-sdk-node

This SDK is an implementation to the Azure API Management REST API. The original
documentation can be found on [Microsoft's documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/apimanagement/apimanagementrest/api-management-rest)
I am still developing this and currently only a couple of things are implemented.

## Usage

I'll write this when I have more things ready.

## Implementation Status

Check [Implementations Documentation](./docs/implementations.md) to see the
status of current implementation.
